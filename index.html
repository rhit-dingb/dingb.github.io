    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
        Hi!  My name is Bowen Ding.  I am currently a Sophmore student at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. I'm currently taking CSSE280 course this quarter, this course is about web introduction and it's very fun!
    </p>
    <p>
      My major is computer science major and I also have a Japanese minor. For this quarter, 
      I am taking an introduction to web design class, and I also had an Internship at Rose-Hulman Ventures for developing a mobile-app. 
      I used react-redux as the framework and VS code for the environment. 
    </p>
    <p>
      My hometown is Beijing, China. As an International student here at Rose, 
      I have stayed for an entire year here at Terre Haute due to the Covid-19 circumstance. 
      I took some summer courses at Rose to spend my summer vacation. 
      The fun thing that Iâ€™ve done during the summer break is that I drove for 4000 miles from Terre Haute to the Yellow Stone Nation Park and spent there for a week. 
      I was amazed by the beautiful landscapes and I took a lot of pictures there. During my free time, 
      I enjoyed doing sports, and I am also a big basketball fan, too. I am also very good at cooking, and I always cook a lot of food on weekends when I have the time.
